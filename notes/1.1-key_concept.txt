MCP = “USB-C for AI”
Just like USB-C is a universal connector, MCP is a universal protocol to plug AI into tools/data.

🧩 The M×N Integration Problem
Without MCP:
M apps × N tools = Too many custom integrations → not scalable.

With MCP:
Each app (M) uses 1 client, Each tool (N) exposes 1 server
➤ Result: Just M + N total integrations. Scalable!


🧩 Core MCP Components

| Component  | Role                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host**   | AI app the user interacts with (e.g., Claude, IDE, SDK) |
| **Client** | MCP connector inside Host that talks to tools           |
| **Server** | External tool or data source exposing MCP capabilities  |
📌 Client ≠ Host exactly — but they work together.
