Unit 1: Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Why MCP Matters:--

Current Limitation: LLMs canâ€™t access real-time info or external tools directly.

MCPâ€™s Role: Acts as a bridge between models and external data sources or environments.

Goal: Let models become interactive, context-aware, and more useful in real-world scenarios.

ðŸ§© What Will Be Covered in Detail
What is MCP?
â€“ Definition and its role in modern AI.

Key Concepts & Terminology
â€“ Such as roles, tools, memory, and schemas (coming up in later units too).

Integration Challenges
â€“ Especially the MÃ—N Problem (when multiple models/tools need to connect in a scalable way).

Benefits and Goals
â€“ Like standardization, scalability, and interoperability.

Simple Integration Example
â€“ To help you visualize how MCP looks in practice.
